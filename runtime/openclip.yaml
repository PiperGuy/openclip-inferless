#
# Custom Runtime allows you to customize the container to have the software and dependency that we need to run OpenCLIP. 
# system_packages : 
# These are any libraries that you need for the model to run, for eg: "opencv" for image processing or like "ffmpeg" to open the audio files. 
# python_packages :
# These are pip-based libraries that you need in your Python runtime for example torch is required to load PyTorch-based models
